This is my homepage, my name is Howard Horning and I'm a student at Cal State Fullerton and I'm majoring in Electrical Engineering. 

## Here's some of my favorite projects from this semester:

### CPSC 120

* Lab 2

    Lab 2 was our first look at using git, properly setting up out account and our Personal Authentification Token (PAT). The process of deciding how much power to give our token was really interesting because while it was tempting to check off all the boxes and be able to do anything from the start, it was wiser to start with what we needed to have access to. This concept can be applie to many different parts of education and my career, to start small until I can effectively use more abstract functions.


* Lab 6

    Lab 6 was our introduction to using nested loops and if statements. My favorite part of this lab was part 1 because it had us write code that created a pattern. This exercise cemented in my mind the importance, reliability, and simplicity that loops can give programs. Another lesson I took from this lab was how drawing out pictures when working with a partner can be beneficial because people can have wildly different ideas when approaching the same problem, so having ways to communicate our ideas clearly was a good skill to this about from this activity.


* Lab 10

    Lab 10 tasked us with utilizing two dimensional arrays, using unittests, and writing funciton definitions outside of the main. My favorite part of this lab was part 1, this is because the program had to read values given by the user and determine if the area of a rectangle could be made, the code then had to be written with the possibility that user error could introduce values with the wrong type, like strings, into the code. This taught a valuable lesson that when we can, it is always useful to make code adaptable if a mismatch of types comes, because then a way to see what went wrong is already written in.
